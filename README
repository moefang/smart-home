There are three different parts: multi-tracker, uwb and miband. 

Before runing. Please make sure that you have installed scikit-learn.

1, multi-tracker: it is implemented for presence tracking for multiple residents (here, we have 2 residents).

How to run?
$ python multiTracker_NB.py

It is used for runing trackers implemented by NB.

$ python multiTracker_HMM.py

It is used for running trackers implemented by HMM.


2, uwb: it is used for testing uwb data.

How to run?
If you have train data and test data then use
$ python classification4uwb.py train test

train is the file name of the train data. test is the file name of the test data.

If you have a dataset and want to do CV (here, we use 3 folds cv) then use
$ python classification_CV4uwb.py data

data is the file name of input data.

If you have a dataset and want to do PCA for selecting features then use
$ python classification_PCA4uwb.py data 3

data is file name of the input data. 3 is the number of selected features. Here, we also use 3 folds cv.


3, miband: it is used for testing miband data.
It contains three precedures: download data from remote mysql server, format the raw data and test the data.

To download data from remote mysql server, please use
$ python getDataFromDB.py "select .. where .. " rawdata

The "select .. where .. " should be replaced by your query string according to your requirements. rawdata is the file name of output file.

To format the raw data, please use
$ python preprocessData.py labels rawdata newdata

labels is the file name of labels. rawdata is the file name of rawdata (from mysql). newdata is the file name of output file.

To test the data, please use
$ python test4miband.py data

data is the file name of the input data. 

In this testing, there are two algorithms implemented: one is maximal value and another one is nb-histogram.
